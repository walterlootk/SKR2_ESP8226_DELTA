I have an AnyCubic Kossel Pulley 3D printer since April 2017. Sometime in August 2021 I got hold of an SKR 2 Rev B board and four TMC2209 drivers. Everything else has remain more or less the same.
It was also during this time the 8-bit Trigorilla board died, hence initiating the SKR2 replacement on my AnyCubic.
